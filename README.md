# Maersk Container Optimization (CMU Capstone Project)

## 🚢 Overview
As part of my MSBA capstone at Carnegie Mellon, I developed a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to optimize container transportation for Maersk’s North American network. The model minimized costs while accounting for constraints like driver hours-of-service, appointment windows, fleet types, and container compatibility.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- Python (Gurobi, Pandas)
- SQL
- Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)
- MTZ Formulations
- Network Design Optimization

## 📊 Business Impact
- Optimized 50+ distribution nodes and 200+ customer locations
- Incorporated 15% fixed fleet cost advantage into routing logic
- Simulated scalable strategy to reduce transportation cost by ~15%
- Presented results to senior leadership; model used to inform planning
